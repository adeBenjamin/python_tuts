Dude.. i just added text to a file from the python cliNew line + random text/nNew line + random text
New line + random text

>>> help(open) on the py terminal will show options for the open modules

to add text takes three steps:
1 - newfile = open("file.txt", 'w') # the w option is an argument that gets passed to create a NEW file called file.text
2 - newfile.write("sometext sometext \nNewline + plus some more text")
3 - newfile.close() # saves and closes the file

append to the end of the file:
1 - newfile = open..... add the 'a' argument to append file at the end
2 - ....
3 - .close()
